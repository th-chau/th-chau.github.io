## About

Hi! My name is Tak-Huen, and I am a PhD student in political science at UC Berkeley. My current projects are mostly on behavioral formal theory and their empirical implications. More specifically, I am interested in substantive questions on beliefs formation, social identities, social movements, and the region of East Asia. Previously, I worked on empirical projects related to the Hong Kong protests.

Prior to Berkeley, I attended public schools in Sha Tin, Hong Kong, and read for a BA in Philosophy, Politics and Economics at Merton College, University of Oxford on full financial aid.
