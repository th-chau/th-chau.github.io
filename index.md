## About

Hi! My name is Tak-Huen, and I am a PhD candidate in political science (comparative / methods / East Asia) and an MA candidate in economics (theory / PE) at UC Berkeley. I am interested in formal theory, beliefs formation, social identities, social movements, and the region of East Asia. Previously, I worked on empirical projects related to the Hong Kong protests.

Prior to Berkeley, I attended public schools in Sha Tin, Hong Kong, and read for a BA in Philosophy, Politics and Economics at Merton College, University of Oxford on full financial aid.
