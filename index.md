# About

Hi! My name is Tak-Huen (pronounced dāk hyūn), and I am a PhD student in political science at UC Berkeley. Broadly, I am interested in democratization, nationalism, social identity and social movements, with a regional interest in East Asia. Methodologically, I am interested in formal theory and experimental methods. Prior to Berkeley, I attended local public schools in Sha Tin, Hong Kong, and read for a BA in Philosophy, Politics and Economics at Merton College, University of Oxford.
